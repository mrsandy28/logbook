        <div class="box">History<p>The first feline-like mammal, Proailurus, evolved about 30 million years ago. 
            Cats that resemble modern felids first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch, about 5.3 to 3.6 million years ago. 
            The domestic cat evolved from the African wildcat, Felis silvestris lybica, in the Fertile Crescent about 10,000 years ago. </p></div>
        <div class="box">Lifespan<p>The normal lifespan of a domestic cat is 13 to 20 years.
            As cats age, they may experience dental disease, arthritis, and loss of olfaction.</p></div>
        <div class="box">Conclusion<p>Cats, also called domestic cats (Felis catus), are small, carnivorous (meat eating) mammals, of the family Felidae. Cats have been domesticated (tamed) for nearly 10,000 years. Domestic cats may be called 'house cats' when kept as indoor pets. They are one of the most popular pets in the world.</p></div>
